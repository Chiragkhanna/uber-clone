Node.js: The latest stable version of Node.js is required to run the project. You can download it from the official website: https://nodejs.org/
npm (Node Package Manager): npm is included with Node.js installation. You can check if it’s installed by running npm -v in your terminal or command prompt.
Expo CLI: Expo CLI is a command-line tool that you can use to create, build, and deploy your React Native apps. You can install it globally by running npm install -g expo-cli in your terminal or command prompt.
A code editor: A code editor such as Visual Studio Code, Atom, or Sublime Text is recommended for editing the project files.

## Getting Started

Clone the repository: Open your terminal or command prompt and run git clone  to clone the project repository to your local machine.
Install dependencies: Navigate to the project directory by running cd  and then run npm install to install all the necessary dependencies for the project.
Start the app: Run `expo start` in your terminal or command prompt to start the app in development mode. This will open up a QR code that you can scan using the Expo app on your mobile device to preview the app. Alternatively, you can also open up the app in a web browser by selecting “Web” from the list of available options in the Expo Developer Tools window that opens up in your browser after running expo start.
